# Essentials of Mathematical Methods
This repo contains my online evolving book **Essentials of Mathematical Methods: Foundations, Principles, and Algorithms**. It surveys fundamental results in major branches of applied mathematics, with emphasized applications in **stochastic system modeling, statistical learning, and optimal decision-making**.
